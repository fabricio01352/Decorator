If you know that an object could change in the future, you might want to implement a decorator with that possible change, example, a bank can ofer normal accounts to the client, but the client can also choose to have the extra shield, this extra is not something
necessary, but it can be added, it is not something inherit from the class, but if the client wants it, it will be added to the object.
